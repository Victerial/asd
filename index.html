            <h2>Transmission</h2>
            <p>The Koenigsegg Jesko features an all-new 9-speed, multi-clutch transmission – 100% designed
                and built in-house at Koenigsegg. The Light Speed Transmission (LST) represents a scale of
                evolution not seen since the development of modern dual-clutch technology at the turn of the
                century.
                
                LST comprises nine forward gears and seven wet, multidisc clutches in a compact, ultra-light
                package. The LST is capable of upward and downward gear changes between gears at near light
                speed thanks to the simultaneous opening and closing of clutches that allow for totally seamless
                acceleration or deceleration.
                
                That LST gear changes can occur in virtually zero time between adjacent gears is impressive. But
                what takes LST from impressive to evolutionary, however, is that these shift-time benefits apply
                when changing between ANY forward gears.</p>
